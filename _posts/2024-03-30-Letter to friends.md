Hello! Welcome to my blog, which includes notes for RMT, LDP, FPT, and other aspects concerning probability and statistics. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my blog.

Now I am reading the following books:

- **Topics in random matrix theory** by [Terence Tao](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/)
- **Spectral analysis of large dimensional random matrices** by [Zhidong Bai](https://js.nenu.edu.cn/teacher/index_fix.php) and [Jack W. Silverstein](https://jack.math.ncsu.edu/)
